* Recompiling for a new NuGet Package is fuzzy, yet. It cannot be done in the ExpHive, only in the original.
	* Trick: Instead of clearing the NuGet cache, find the .nuget packages in c:\users\username and delete the control.package instead.
* When the ViewModelClientFactory is missing, it says "No IViewModelFactory exported with the type TileRepeaterTemplateAssignmentViewModel". Shouldn't it be "...Client"?
* Note: We can put the Designer Attribute on Properties as well as on classes. Mention!

* Note: We need better Exception Reporting, if we are encountering a double Endpoint definition. It's a nightmare to debug.
  D:\git\winforms-designer\src\Microsoft.DotNet.DesignTools.Protocol\ProtocolDefinition_Endpoints.cs, Line 23, we to report _what_ endpoint caused the exception.

  Note: We need to show any exception which might have occured in the CollectionEditor.cs in Microsoft.Dotnet.DesignTools.Client, so people would know 
        what lead to a unexpected closing of the dialog without showing any error message.
